Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. Design, development,testing, deployment and maintainance are some of the key features of software engineering.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
A systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools in order to develop and maintain high quality software systems. Software engineering and traditional programming do have differences. Traditional programming entails more of coding whilst software engineering evolves around the software development life cycle. This entails sequential phases such as requirements, design, implementation,testing, deployemt and maintanance. Specific problems are resolved using tradional programming while software engineering focuses on fast efficent products that are easy to maintain through scientific and mathematical principles.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Software Development Life Cycle entails a detailed sequential phases. These include: system requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment and maintanance. These are pivotal to the SDLC. 
Requirements pertains the gathering of information such as system requiremets.
Design asks the question "How will we get what we want?" Requirements are analysed so as to identify the best solutions to design a software. This helps in creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implentation : Coding begins. It is a process of creating what we want through coding. Specifications within the blueprint are used a guidelines. 
Testing then follows. This check if the target or requirement was met. automatic and manual testing are employed to check for bugs and wether it meets client needs or requirements. This ensures that the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment involves the use of the developed software. It involves giving the software access to the customers.
Maintanance is the last on the rack.The team fixes bugs, resolves customer issues, and manages software changes. In addition, the team monitors overall system performance, security, and user experience to identify new ways to improve the existing software. This is a continous support which includes updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.



Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Agile is the iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. It arranges the SDLC into several development cycles. Agile enables quick response to change making it more efficient than other models. It enable engagement with customer and stakeholders to get feedback through the project's lifecycle. However over reliace from the customer's feedback may end up chaning the whole perspective of the project.

Waterfall follows a sequential order with distinct phases. It relies on step by step foundations with each phase depending on the previous phase.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Similarities between Agile and Waterfall models. 
They are both software methodologies. 
they differ in that the waterfall has phases which build upon each other just like a waterfall. Each phase waterfalls into the next phase.
Agile on the other hand splits the projects into cycles. The first cycle should be released and tested before  the next cycle begins. Therefore with Agile there is a succession of releases unlike in Waterfall.
In a nutshell, Agile is -quick to response to changes, it has regular customer feedback and an improved team collaboration. On the other hand Waterfall has a clear structure and documentation as well as easy to manage due to its rigidity.
Agile is bet suited where stakeholders are closely involved every step of the way and Waterfall is for long term project.
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.


Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design.
This entails the division of a software. "Modularity is the practise of separating apart individual parts of a larger software system to be used independently. These parts may be built, tested, and maintained separately from the rest of the system, and then combined at a later time". NIIT EDitorial.

 How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
 This enebles code to be read easily and tests on the code are done very fast. Since there are modules, it makes it easier to find things later. Some parts of the software can be altered without having to redo the whole project.Therefore less bugs or errors are encountered on the software hence making it easy to maintain. Modular software architecture addresses these challenges by breaking down complex systems into smaller, manageable modules. These modules function independently while also collaborating seamlessly within the larger software system. This approach simplifies the addition of new features, improvements/updates, hence scaling the software.



Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). 
Software testing has different levels. 
Unit Testing is done. Thorough checks are made on each component to ensure it fuctions properly on the software.
Integration Testing: Checks on how the components fuction when they are combined. 
System Testing: The whole system is tested as a package. 
Acceptance Testing: The product is released to the end users where they have a feel of it and check if it meets their requirements.

Why is testing crucial in software development?
It ensures software system functions correclty. Security measures are taken care of as well as ensuring that stakeholders needs are met hence providing proper software to the end user. 

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Atlassian describes version control system as software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. For example Git can easily track your history,create backups, its scallable and supports collaboration. 

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
The roles of a software project include project planning, risk management and resource management. Challenges that can be faced include Scope, schedule, budget and risk management. 


Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintanace is the process of changing and updating software to keep up with end user needs. Different types of software maintanance include corrective software maintanance, adaptive software maintanace, preventative software maintance and perfective software maintanance. 
Corrective involves software maintenance is necessary when something goes wrong in a piece of software including faults and errors. These can affect how a software functions. Preventative software maintenance is looking into the future so that your software can keep working as desired for as long as possible. Adaptive software maintenance has to do with the changing technologies as well as policies and rules regarding your software.


Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
According to Techtarget the following are ethical issues that software engineers might face. These are addictive design, alogrithm bias, weak cyber security and personally identifiable information protection, corporate ownership of personal data as well as overemphasis on features.
For software engineers to ensure they adhere to ethical standards, proffesional standards must be followed guided by the code of ethics.
